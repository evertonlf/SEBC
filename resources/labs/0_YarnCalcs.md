I upgrade memory to 512GB in the worker nodes to get the best performance I will use the cluster with Hive, Spark and Impala, and I adjust memory of the OS to 5% of the total of the host that a think that is sufficient.

I upgrade cpu of the workers to 24 cores is better to distributed resources of the cluster and yarn containers and map reduce jobs.
